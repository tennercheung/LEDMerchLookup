## Bill of Materials (BOM)
1. Raspberry Pi
2. 8GB+ Class 10 Micro SD card
3. USB Wifi dongle (for Pi's before model 3)
4. 5V PSU rated for 2.5A + 0.06A x number of RGB lights used + 1.5A for safety or any future plans
5. 1000uF 10V+ capacitor
6. Row of 20 female header pins
7. Protohat or 20Ã—10 double sided perfboard
8. Two slot screw terminals x2
9. Three slot screw terminal 
10. Micro USB cable
11. 18-20 AWG Wire
12. 220-470 Ohm 0.25W+ resistor 

## Software 

* Flash SD card with newest Raspbian IMG
* Do general setup: wifi, password change from default, etc
* Install adafruit circuitpython for the RGB LEDs with:
*sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel*
* Disable login
* Enable VNC Server (note the IP addr for client connecting)
* Running boot.py at boot https://bit.ly/2Zp2eAo

## Hardware

* Capacitor goes parallel with the PSU, Micro USB cable and the RGB LEDs' power lines
* GND (third pin from the top row) connects to the ground of the parallel connections
* Resistor goes between GPIO8 (sixth pin from the top row) and the RGB LEDs' DATAIN cable
